title:  "An update on bpfilter"
---

This post will detail the current state of `bpfilter` and how it approaches features and constraints for packet filtering.

The project has witnessed significant progress over the last couple of months, comparable to the progress made during the whole prior year: there has been a significant increase in development pace. It's a well-known fact that the number of commits in a project isn't reflective of the quality of the work, but lacking a better indicator: the project recorded [257 contributions between July 2023 and August 2024](https://github.com/facebook/bpfilter/commits/main/?since=2023-07-01&until=2024-07-31), but [229 contributions over the last two months](https://github.com/facebook/bpfilter/commits/main/?since=2024-08-01&until=2024-09-30).

## Current State

**Documentation**

The `bpfilter` documentation is automatically generated and published at [bpfilter.io](https://bpfilter.io/) for every merged pull request. The documentation is split in two parts: the user documentation, which explains how to use `bpfilter`, and the developer documentation, which details the project's internals.

The user documentation has been updated with existing features. The ["Usage"](https://bpfilter.io/usage/index.html) page is a good starting point if you want to try `bpfilter`. The developer documentation has also been improved, but to a lesser extent: itâ€™s accurate, but not all the components are documented.

There was previously a page on [bpfilter.io](https://bpfilter.io/) that would contain a reference to the complete internal API of the project. This page was filled with unorganized internal API details, brought no value to the documentation, and was very slow to generate. It has been removed in favor of a per-component documentation, which is more usable.

Apart from improving the documentation by importing more of the source code documentation into it, the developer documentation would also benefit from a high-level overview of the project: what are the different components and how they work together. A few schema and diagrams would help!

Finally, `bpfilter` crossed 100 stars on GitHub (125 and counting!), and a logo was designed to celebrate this milestone!

**Front-ends**

> Front-ends are the components used to translate the filtering rules coming from `nftables`/`iptables`/`bfcli` into an internal format which used to generate the BPF programs.

Let's start with `iptables`: not much has changed. You can still filter on IP address (source and destination), protocol, and network interface. Not all the new matchers have yet been integrated into the `iptables` front-end, but will soon.

`nftables`, on the other hand, is not in a good shape. Recent progress on `bpfilter` revealed some limitations to this front-end and the need to refactor it in a way that would allow it to evolve. Unfortunately, I don't have the bandwidth to do it right now, but it's one of my top priorities. To provide more context, `nft` (`nftables`' command line interface) will parse the filtering rules, convert them into `nftables` bytecode, and send them to the kernel. `bpfilter` has to work from this bytecode and convert it into an internal ruleset representation, which is not an easy task. The trick is to successfully map one or more instructions back to a single object in `bpfilter` (usually a matcher). I look forward to when I'll have enough time to actually fix this once and for all.

A third front-end (and CLI) has been added to `bpfilter` during the last months: `bfcli`. `bfcli` provides more flexibility to combine different features provided by `bpfilter`: filter on XDP or a cgroup, drop a specific IPv4 address, match a layer 4 protocol or IPv6 optional field. Not all those combinations can be done using `iptables` or `nftables`. Because `bfcli` uses `bpfilter`'s internal structures to represent the filtering rules, integrating and testing new features is easier and faster: no translation layer needed. The ruleset is serialized by `bfcli`, sent to the daemon, and deserialized. `bfcli` is not meant to be the main CLI for `bpfilter`, nor a replacement for `nftables` or `iptables`, but a different tool for different use cases. If you are eager to know more about `bfcli`, read the [documentation](https://bpfilter.io/usage/bfcli.html). Here's a commented example of a ruleset:

```c
# Create a chain attached to XDP, accept packets that doesn't match any rule.
chain BF_HOOK_XDP policy ACCEPT
    rule
        # Drop packets coming from 192.168.1.{131,132}
        # Keep a counter of the number of packets and bytes dropped
        ip4.saddr in {192.168.1.131,192.168.1.132}
        counter
        DROP
    rule
        # Drop packets coming from fc00::fbaf:7b6b:ba41:abce
        ip6.saddr fc00::fbaf:7b6b:ba41:abce
        DROP
```

**Filtering rules**

The way `bpfilter` defines filtering rules has also evolved since 2023: the structure is now simpler, easier to understand.

The `chain` is the high-level object used by `bpfilter` to represent filtering rules. A chain will be converted into a BPF program, then attached to a specific hook in the kernel. Consequently, a chain is composed of:

- The name of the hook it should filter from
- A default action (`policy`) to perform in case no rule matches the packet
- A list of sets, which are described below
- A list of rules

</figure>

The `set` is a new type of object introduced recently, and it behaves similarly to the sets defined in `nftables`: you can create a set containing multiple elements of the same type, and filter on this set using a single instruction. Sets are centralized within the chain, so they could be used by multiple rules.

A `rule` now contains one or more `matchers`. A matcher represents a matching criterion for a packet: it could match against the packet's IPv6 source address, or a TCP flag, or the layer 3 protocol type. The [documentation](https://bpfilter.io/usage/bfcli.html#matchers) contains the list of matchers supported by `bfcli` and the [definition of a matcher](https://github.com/facebook/bpfilter/blob/0a1df7c79a3fc1a1d84efd63472a41359f80d8f3/src/core/matcher.h#L138-L148). Apart from a list of `matchers`, a rule also contains a `verdict` to apply to the packet if the `matchers` match, and a boolean to state whether `bpfilter` should maintain a counter of bytes and packets matched by the rule.

**Bytecode generation**

The logic used by `bpfilter` to generate the bytecode evolves and grows according to the new features introduced in the codebase. Matchers are a good example of this, as they require specific bytecode to be generated to properly parse the packet and compare it to reference data.

`bpfilter` relies on a codegen (`struct bf_cgen`) object to represent the bytecode generation context. A codegen contains a reference to a chain (the ruleset), and a BPF program (`struct bf_program`).

Originally, `bpfilter` would create multiple programs for a codegen: one program for each network interface. But this was a subpar solution: some hooks are defined per-interface (e.g. XDP), while others apply to every network interface (`BPF_NETFILTER`). This behavior has been modified so a codegen generates a single BPF program, but multiple codegens can be defined for XDP and TC hooks. A user can choose which interface to attach their XDP or TC chain using the [hook's `ifindex` option](https://bpfilter.io/usage/bfcli.html#chains).

Each BPF program generated for a codegen will be called every time a packet passes through the hook it is attached to and perform the following action:
- Initialize a small runtime context to store metadata that might be used to filter the packet more efficiently
- Execute the filtering rules in the order they are defined in the chain, such that:
  - If every `matcher` of the rule matches the packet, it means the rule itself matched the packet, and we can update the counter (if the rule has counters), stop processing subsequent rules, and return the rule's verdict
  - If at least one of the `matcher`s doesn't match the packet, we stop processing the current rule and continue with the next one
- Once we processed all the rules, if we haven't returned yet, it means no rule matched the packet, and we can then return the chain's policy (default action)

</figure>

The main change to the bytecode generation impacts how a packet is pre-processed by the BPF program. The BPF program will parse the headers (L2, L3, L4) of the packet, store relevant metadata (protocol, header size) into the program's runtime context. Pre-processing the packet's headers reduces a matcher to two actions: check if the packet contains the protocol the matcher supports (e.g. only IPv6 packets can be processed by an IPv6 source address matcher), and perform the actual comparison with the matcher's reference data. This behavior allows a chain to define rules to filter different protocols from the same layer (e.g. filtering on IPv4 and IPv6 in the same chain).

The size of the generated bytecode has been decreased by removing superfluous instructions and simplifying some features.

**Tests and quality**

`bpfilter` relies heavily on unit tests, the code coverage has increased since the last update and pull requests are not allowed to reduce the overall coverage.

Currently, there is a big blind spot to `bpfilter` testing, which is the bytecode generation component. The generated bytecode is not automatically tested, nor is it automatically testable at the moment. This is an issue that will grow as `bpfilter` supports more and more features. A solution to this issue is described in the [Next](#next) section below.

**Project management**

Waiting to publish an update after a year is clearly too long. The intention going forward is for more regular updates, which will benefit both users and maintainers.

Until I can establish a more centralized location for the roadmap and milestones, I will add tasks to the GitHub Project and create the relevant GitHub issues for those. You can take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/facebook/bpfilter/issues) if you want to have an idea of the current work.

## Next

Now let's take some time to focus on the future of the project. Most of the latest `bpfilter` features are derived from an internal need at Meta, but I would like to work more on external integrations.

**Extent filtering capabilities (H2 2024)**

- Support for cgroup hooks, to attach a generated BPF program directly to a cgroup
- Improve `sets` support: sets are quite new to `bpfilter` and they will be expanded to support more types of data (IPv6, combination of IP and port, etc.)
- Expand existing matchers with more operators
- Support ranges (e.g. port range)

**Packaging `bpfilter` for RPM/DEB (H2 2024)**

Currently, you need to manually build `bpfilter` if you want to test it. Itâ€™s cumbersome and could repel potential users. Packaging `bpfilter` into a DEB and RPM package will remove this limitation and could grow the number of users and contributors.

**Fix `nftables` support (H2 2024?)**

Support for `nftables` is essential. `nftables` requires a custom patch to support `bpfilter`, this patch is in the project's repository, and `nftables` can be built easily with `make nftables`. I would love to see `nftables` use `bpfilter` as a way to offload filtering to XDP in the future. I would like to spend time on this task: I think it could benefit both `bpfilter` and `nftables`.

**End-to-end testing (H1 2025)**

End-to-end testing is currently non-existent, but it's a critical part to ensure `bpfilter` is reliable. Given 3 front-ends and many matchers, end-to-end testing is the only way to quickly validate the generated programs. A solution  would be to create a testing framework to perform the following:

- Manage `bpfilter` lifetime: start/stop the daemon, clean-up the cache or the BPF programs if needed
- Define filtering rules using `bfcli`.
- Craft packets and compare the program's behavior to the expected results. The framework could send the packet to the interface the chain is attached to and read the rules counters to ensure the packet was accepted/dropped as expected.

**Smarter bytecode generation**

Reducing the bytecode size would improve performance of the generated BPF program. This could be done by parsing protocol headers based on usage. A chain that doesn't contain a matcher for the TCP protocol doesn't need to parse the TCP header, or include any logic that refers to the TCP protocol. Similarly, a chain matching exclusively on layer 3 protocols doesn't need any logic to parse the layer 4 protocols.

Additionally, the preprocessing logic could be generated once (and cached) as it's identical from a program to another, or even better: be implemented in C as part of `bpfilter`'s sources and copied directly to the final BPF programs.

**Custom bytecode**

What if a user could write C code to perform whatever complex packet filtering logic they want to, compile it and send it to `bpfilter` to be used in a chain? `bpfilter` could generate the BPF program as it does currently, but one of the rules (or matcher) would defer its verdict to a user-provided BPF function. This would allow users to define their own filtering logic, without relying on `bpfilter`â€™s developers to implement the required matchers.

This idea was originally suggested by Daniel Borkmann and it seems promising.

## Final word

This post is long enough already, so I'll cut it short: if you have any questions, if you need help with `bpfilter`, if you have any feedback, please reach out to `qde@naccy.de`! :)
